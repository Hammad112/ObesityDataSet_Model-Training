### Step 1: Data Cleaning and Imputation

1. **Check Dataset Structure**: Load the dataset (`ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv`), examine its structure, and identify any missing or incorrect values.

2. **Impute Missing Values**: For columns with missing values, impute using the mean of that column.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Height and Weight Distribution**:
   - Visualize the distribution of heights and weights.

2. **Top 10 Ages with Highest Weight**:
   - Identify and visualize the top 10 ages with the highest average weight.

3. **Distribution of CAEC values**:
   - Explore and visualize the distribution of CAEC (Consumption of Alcoholic Drinks) values.

4. **Average Ages with Family History of Overweight**:
   - Calculate and visualize the average ages of individuals with and without a family history of overweight.

5. **Correlation Matrix**:
   - Construct a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different variables.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

1. **Label Encoding**: Apply label encoding to categorical columns.
2. **Standard Scaling**: Apply standard scaling to continuous columns.
3. **One-Hot Encoding**: Perform one-hot encoding on categorical columns that require it.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### Step 4: Model Selection

- Determine whether predicting `NObeyesdad` is a regression or classification problem.
- Choose appropriate algorithms based on the problem type (e.g., classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
